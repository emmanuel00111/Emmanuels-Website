                        <p class="p-2">Over the summer of 2023, I have been able to sign up for "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" course  by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy, I was able to come far as to be able to understand basic-fairly advanced web development processes and techniques. I was then able to apply this knowledge to the creation of my own personal website where I can more accurately represent what it is I have learned from this course.</p>
                        <p class="p-1">Although I am still enrolled in this course as of present, I can confidently say that the knowledge I have gained greatly outweighs what I would have been able to learn had I enrolled in free resources available on the internet. It is an investment I seen necessary as it works on a scope outside my current level in my university.</p>
                        <p class="p-1">By the end of this course I would be able to acquire a certificate of completion and have a fluent understanding of tools and technologies relating to web development and design</p>

                    <li class="black"><header><h4>Interactive mini-games</h4></header>
                        <p class="p-2">Enrolled in "The Art of Doing: Video Game Creation With Python and Pygame" Course by Michael Eramo. Throughout this course I was able to learn the basics when it comes to using the pygame library and its resources. This course focused on creating games such as Snake, Zombie Knight and Space Invaders. With that knowledge I was then able to create my own personal implementations of already created concepts in minigames. I made a tic-tac-toe game and then also went on to create a pac-man game of my own</p>

                    </li>
                    <li class="black"><header><h4>Ongoing Grades/GPA Calculator Website</h4></header>
                        <p class="p-1">With my completion of SYSC 2004 "Object Oriented Software Development" at Carleton University, I thought it would be a useful and necessary tool to be able to use my new found knowledge of object oriented programming in Java to make a tool that focuses on helping students determine if they are on the right track as far as grades go in their respective programs. I was able to make use of a GUI, Java classes and related interfaces to implement this project.</p>
                        <p class="p-1">The goal of this project was to be able to provide my peers with a public resource where they can gain an accurate representation of where their grades are at, and what they would need to succeed granted the information they provided was accurate and complete. I left room for estimates to be made so students can see where their overall marks would be at given their marks fall within a certain range.</p>
                        <p class="p-1"> The idea behind this project was me seeing that since my first year in university, I have had friends come up to me to ask for assistance with calculating where their overall grades were at in a course. As this didn't seem to be a problem for me where I would basically look into their course outlines to determine the weighting of each assessment(assignments, tests, exams...) and their current grades to determine where they currently stand and what they would need in order to reach their desired grade point. My understanding of Object-Oriented programming both proved to be the most effective method to tackling the problem (as procedural programming usually needs a certain "structure" to its problems) and opened my mind to the idea that this resource can just be made accessible to all students and there would be no need to account for human error(if programmed correctly).</p>
                        <p class="p-1">The final step to this project which I am still yet to implement would be to make use of my newly gained web development knowledge and figure out how to transfer my code to its own separate website (or application if necessary) as there seems to be a learning curve for students outside programming related fields to run the code to its maximum efficiency.</p>
