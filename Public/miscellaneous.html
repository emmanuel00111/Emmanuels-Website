            <p class="py-4">I've covered almost all the relevant content for my website, so I'd like to take this opportunity to delve a bit deeper into some of my hobbies. While some might see it as "Irrelevant Information," I believe that sharing my passions can provide a more comprehensive picture of who I am beyond the technical aspects. It's a chance for me to offer a glimpse into my interests and personality, which I hope you'll find interesting and enjoyable to read</p>
            <p class="py-4">I enjoy watching alot of anime and animated videos in general (including cartoons). I loved them so much I made an animation youtube channel in my final years of highschool and over the summers. So I am familiar with omst animation softwares and able to use a handfull of Adobe resources such as Photoshop, Animate, Premier pro, After effects and Media encoder. </p>
            <p class="py-4">I also enjoy playing outdoor games such as soccer and basketball, and I'd also venture to sayI hold a commendable skill level in these sports. I don't know how to swim , but I'm looking forward to signing up for classes to learn how to. I'm also really good at video games aswell, particularly when it comes to PlayStation games(or consoles in general). My proficiency shines in a range of genres including FIFA, navigating first person shooter games like most of the Call of Duty releases and Rainbow Six Siege. I also enjoy playing storyline adventure games, where I challenge myself to complete titles in good time. These include games like Spider-Man 1 and 2, the majority of the God of War series, Uncharted 1-4 and Tomb raider. I must confess I do not dedicate as much time to NBA 2K so I cannot speak on my skill level on said game.</p>
            <p class="py-4">I have found that a negative trait I may possess is obsessing over the details of a situation till I'm completely satisfied with it's result. This may seem fine till I become unsure of what a satisfactory result actually looks like. I have found myself practicing a particular skill for far more time than necessary and taking time away from rest and other skills for the sake of developing the one I am unsatisfied with. I wouldn't call myself a perfectionist as I believe I know when something is done well enough, I usually just don't know how to accept when I am unable to complete those tasks to my satisfaction.</p>
            <p class="py-4">If I am able to think of any more traits of attributes to add to this section (or its removal/remaking in general), I'll make sure to add in said changes. Thankyou for your time.</p>
